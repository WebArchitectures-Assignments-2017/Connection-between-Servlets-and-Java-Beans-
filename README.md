# Introduction:
This assignment is about java servlets, JSP and Filters used in a java dynamic web project. Its goal
was to create a web project (web site) that works as user interface used to access a DB through an
Enterprise JavaBean developed for the fourth assignment.
The web site must contains the same functionalities used in the two clients developed for the 4th
assignment.
Basically the requirements was to replace the desktop interface implemented with a web site using
the technologies mentioned above.
The main difference between the old clients and the web site is that for the 4th assignment project,
the client has been divided in two different programs, one used for manage user operation and the
other used to administrator operation assuming that, the person who will use the administrator client
actually is the administrator.
For the web site instead has been chosen, for obvious reasons, to merge the two clients in a single
website, distinguishing normal users from administrator users using the log in. Since the database
was not prepared to handle this, for simplicity the user-name of an administrator user must be
“admin”
